Hi, I’m Luca Comparini  
I’m a Computer Science gradueted at University of Genoa.  
Here you will find both academic projects and personal project.
I put README everywhere so the navigation should be confortable enough.

Check the University repository for Academic-related projectst, you will get a good idea of what i've learned.

Check Personal Projects Repository to see what i'm focus on. (repository still in progress)
  
Most of comments in my code and all of my relations about my projects are in Italian.
If you wanna talk about some project or see some improvements i could do or even for some typo i'll listen here: lc96@protonmail.com
